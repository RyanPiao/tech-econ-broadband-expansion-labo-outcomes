# Step 7 — Weekly Recap (Website-Ready)

## Run scope completed
- Step 2-4 baseline package (already completed in prior run segment).
- **Step 5:** robustness/sensitivity expansion + formal limitations register.
- **Step 6:** reproducibility polish (artifact hashes, requirements snapshot, run metadata, runbook docs).
- **Step 7:** this recap and website-ready summary text.

## Empirical takeaways
- Remote-work outcome: coefficient **-0.1093** (p=1.05e-07); +10pp effect **-0.0109**.
- Income outcome: coefficient **0.4167** (p=9.05e-24); +10pp effect **0.0417**.
- Robustness sign consistency vs baseline: **88%**.
- Robustness specs with p<0.10: **8 / 8**.

## Credibility and limitations (summary)
- High-priority limitations flagged: **3**.
- Most material risks are treatment-proxy validity (subscription vs availability) and pre-trend warning in event-study leads.
- Stage-2 priority: integrate harmonized FCC availability panel and re-estimate with modern staggered-treatment methods.

## Reproducibility package status
- Artifact hashes logged: **8** files (`outputs/step6_artifact_manifest.csv`).
- Environment snapshot: `outputs/step6_requirements_snapshot.csv` and `outputs/step6_run_metadata.json`.
- End-to-end command: `python scripts/run_step2_step7.py`.

## Website-ready blurb
Stage-X (Broadband × Labor): Step5-Step7 continuation completed with robustness/sensitivity checks, limitations register, and reproducibility manifest. Baseline remote-work coefficient remained negative (10pp effect = -0.0109, p=1.05e-07) while income association was positive (10pp effect = 0.0417, p=9.05e-24). Result is documented as directional evidence pending FCC availability integration.
